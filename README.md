# Advent Of Code 2025

This is the first year I'm actually sort of trying to make sort of readable programs:  
I'm commenting more than I usually do, and making the code make more sense.  
This year is only 12 days so I will be attempting each day in python and JavaScript.

See my previous years in the sidebar.
